## Introduction

This is a perverse experiment in running a dungeon crawl for Cyberpunk Red. Why? Because I am mentally unwell and want to practice making materials for other people to use. My three play-tests have proved that the concept can work (though that might just have been due to my amazing players). Given the unusual nature of this and my relative inexperience in sharing my GM materials I have tried to write this as a OSR style dungeon but there is one room where I adopt a more casual style.

Also because I can't find public domain art that feels right, all the art is done by my shitty untrained hand. If you want to fix it, please contact me.
