## 8. Simulated Environment Testing

A set of 4 synthetic environments for testing the dinos capacity as weapons.

> Okay this is where I drop the pretence of being any good at this. CPR kind of demands at least a few combat encounters on a battle map and I am not good at making battle maps. When I have run this I use 4 Loke battle maps as each of the test environments that connect to each other in a circle. Just pick 4 maps that are fun and add doors to the edge.
> 
> The T-Rex starts on the opposite end of the circle to the players and every time they either move to another environ or stay in their current one a bit long I roll a d6. 1-2 the T-Rex goes clockwise to the next environ, 3-4 it stays where it is, 5-6 it goes anti-clockwise.

> Each room also has 2d4-2 raptors and  1d3-1 dilos.
