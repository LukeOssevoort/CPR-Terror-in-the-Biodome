## 2. Decontamination Corridor

A corridor with automatic **doors** at each end. The walls are dotted with hundreds of tiny nozzles that would spray disinfectant from a **tank**, if the **pump** wasn't broken, and the **net architecture** that runs this system cannot compensate for this fault. Instead it attempts to spray, scans for contaminants, then starts a 1 minute cooldown before trying again.

- **Doors**: The door into the corridor from [[1. Security checkpoint]] to the *west* will open and close freely except for 30s during the decontamination sequence where it remains closed. The exit to the lobby to the *east* will only open when the **net architecture** allows.
- **Tank**: The tank of disinfectant in under the floor with a fill port hidden behind a panel in the wall next to the exit door.
- **Pump**: The pump is hidden under the floor and accessible via a floor panel. A *DV15 basic tech* check can repair the pump.
- **Net Architecture**: Access point is hidden behind a panel next to the door at the end of the corridor that blocks the signal. A *DV 9 scan* reveals there is a weak signal coming from the panel, too weak to connect. Beating a *DV21* with this roll allows the netrunner to connect despite this disruption. The net architecture itself operates a bio-scanner that scans for contaminants, sprays disinfectant if there is any, and opens the door if there isn't (see [[A. Net Architectures]]).
