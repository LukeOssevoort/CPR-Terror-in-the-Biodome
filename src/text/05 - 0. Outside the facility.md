## 0. Outside the Facility

Inside the dome is a dense **jungle**. The **air** is humid and the pollution of Night City is notably absent. There is a rough **path** headed towards the **facility** at the centre of the dome.

- **Jungle**: A PC with knowledge of botany could identify that many of these plants are extinct.
- **Air**: The air is humid and clean due to the environmental controls in the dome.
- **Path**: 1 in 6 chance that the crew attacked by 1d4 velociraptors while on the path.
- **Facility**: The path will lead the party to [[1. Security checkpoint]] (on the *west* of the facility) but a perimeter sweep will reveal there is a crack in the *northern* wall leading to [[5. Gestation pods]].
