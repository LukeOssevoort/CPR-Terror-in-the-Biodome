## 1. Security Checkpoint

The front door (in the *western* wall) is blown off its hinges and another group of **edgerunners** have taken up positions in the room while waiting for their **netrunner**.

- **Edgerunners**: A crew consisting of a *security officer* (the leader), 2 *bodyguards*, and a *netrunner* (see next dot point).
- **Netrunner**: The netrunner is ahead (*east*) in the [[2. Decontamination Corridor]], unable to find an access point to the decontamination architecture.
