## 7. Cybernetic Fitting

Torn apart metal cages leading to scraped harnesses are surrounded by modified cyberware and medical equipment in a makeshift vet clinic. Past the equipment a makeshift **barrier** of overturn tables sits in front of a large **reinforced door**.

- **Barrier**: The hastily assembled pile of debris protects 2 **scientists** protecting themselves by manually operating a turret.
- **Reinforced door**: A large steel door with a smaller inset access door to the *east* leading to [[8. Simulated Environment Testing]]. There are 2 other doors, one to the *north-west* leading to [[5. Gestation pods]] and one to the *south-east* leading to [[6. Break room]].
- **Scientists**: 
	- **Dr Felix Datch**: Panicking, irrational, haggard.
	- **Dr Johan Stenz**: Running on adrenaline, barely holding on, in control of the turret. He understands the subtext of the PCs "troubleshooting" mission, and will fire and begin to break down like his colleague if he catches on.
