The PCs are contacted by a BioTechnica (BT) research facility manager, going by the rather transparent code name *Mr Blue*. A facility that he has been running remotely (a bio-dome in the university district) has gone offline and the higher ups are chasing results. This brings him to the PCs who he wants to hire to "troubleshoot" the issue at a rate of 1000eb each. 

**He tells the PCs**

- He manages facilities like the bio-dome remotely because he is squeamish around the research subjects (flora, fauna and various bio-technologies)
- The bio-dome itself contains a jungle with a research facility in the centre
- His research head at the facility is quite passionate about the project and finding him is of the utmost importance
- When pressed he will clarify that troubleshooting means get rid of all evidence of negligence on his part by whatever means necessary

**He does not tell the PCs**

- What the facility is actually researching (genetically engineered dinosaur drones)
- That he had been getting a series of very alarming messages from the research head before the site went offline
- The research head is trying to use the "research" to escape BT servitude using the dino-drones to create an independent nomad state in the desert
- What he means by "whatever means necessary"
