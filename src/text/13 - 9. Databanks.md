## 9. Databanks

Rows of whirring flowing **databanks**, fans expelling heat as **dinos** stalk the room. On the far side of the room is an **office** enclosed in glass.

- **Databanks**: Entire system connected to net-arch that controls (see [[A. Net Architectures]]).
- **Dinos**: 4 velos and 2 dels under the control of the doctor.
- **Office**: **Dr Michael Chen** is in there and has clearly been living there for a few days. If he lives BioTechnica will try to change that. The office also contains:
	- 1d6 x 200eb of biomass
	- A small backpack-sized version of the gestation tube, preconfigured to grow a raptor
	- Techtool used to weld shut the door to [[3. Lobby]]
- **Dr Michael Chen**: Passionate. In open revolt against BioTechnica. Will not stand down.
